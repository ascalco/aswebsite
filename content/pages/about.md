Some of the things that would make me lose track of time:

+ Design, administer, and analyse surveys and questionnaires
+ Evaluate psychometric properties of standardised questionnaires
+ Leverage Behavioural Economics principles to improve users experiences
+ Analyse behavioural data and provide science-driven reccomendations
+ Automate analysis and reports
+ Compile thorough competitive analysis and spot gaps in the market
+ Design and analyse behavioral studies and A/B tests
+ Conduct focus groups and structured interviews
+ Design, conduct, and analyse in-person usability tests
+ Create neat reports and presentations for non-technical audiences

All backed up by enthusiasm, empathy, and a scientific approach to problems.
