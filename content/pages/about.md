Determined, goal-driven and with solid critical thinking skills, I mastered Behavioural Sciences and adopted a scientific approach to problems. Over the past years, I developed artificial simulations of consumer behaviour focused on the programming side until I realised the meaning of user-driven development (see [my project on simulations interfaces](/projects/case_study_MeatNet)). From there, I started reflecting on my experience and skills and realised I had all the tools to make a tangible impact by researching and designign better experiences. 

Some of the things that would make me lose track of time:

+ Design, administer, and analyse surveys and questionnaires
+ Evaluate psychometric properties of standardised questionnaires
+ Leverage Behavioural Economics principles to improve users experiences
+ Analyse behavioural data and provide science-driven reccomendations
+ Design and analyse behavioral studies and A/B tests
+ Conduct focus groups and structured interviews
+ Design, conduct, and analyse in-person usability tests
+ Automate analyses and reports in R
+ Create neat reports and presentations for non-technical audiences
